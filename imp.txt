Cucumber supports hooks, which are blocks of code that run before or after each scenario. 
Cucumber Hooks allows us to better manage the code workflow and helps us to reduce the code redundancy. 
Background in Cucumber is used to define a step or series of steps which are common to all the tests in the feature file. 
It allows you to add some context to the scenarios for a feature where it is defined. 
Background with Hooks

This is so interesting to see the working of Background with Hooks. The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your @Before hook.
To get it straight, let’s assign a task to the Before & After Hookin the same test.
@Before: Print the starting logs
@Before: Start browser and Clear the cookies
@After:  Close the browser
@After: Print the closing logs
->Selenium Grid is used with Selenium RC to execute parallel tests across different browsers and operating systems.
WebDriver, allows test scripts to communicate directly to the browser, thereby controlling it from the OS level.
Selenium is a free (open source) automated testing suite for web applications across different browsers and platforms
Selenium is a collection of different tools
Selenium IDE, a Firefox add-on that you can only use in creating relatively simple test cases and test suites
Selenium RC allows users to use programming languages in creating complex tests
